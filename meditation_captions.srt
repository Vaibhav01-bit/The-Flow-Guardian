1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
When you're ready, press start.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,500
We will begin now.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Inhale slowly through your nose…
two… three… four…

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Hold gently…

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:24,000
and exhale slowly through your mouth…
two… three… four… five… six.

6
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:32,000
Let your shoulders relax.

7
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Again — inhale slowly…

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,000
hold…

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,500
and exhale fully.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
You're doing well.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,000
One last breath together…

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
inhale…

13
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:17,000
and exhale.
