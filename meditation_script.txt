When you're ready, press start.
We will begin now.
Inhale slowly through your nose…
two… three… four…
Hold gently…
and exhale slowly through your mouth…
two… three… four… five… six.
Let your shoulders relax.
Again — inhale slowly…
hold…
and exhale fully.
You're doing well.
One last breath together…
inhale…
and exhale.
